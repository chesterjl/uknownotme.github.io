            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the nearest to the Sun. Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Its surface is covered in tens of thousands of impact craters. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.</p>

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets. Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead.</p>

            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, and the largest and most massive planet in our Solar System. It is famous for its stripy appearance and for the Great Red Spot. Jupiter was the first planet in our Solar System to form. It was probably born much closer to the Sun before migrating to its current position about four billion years ago, scattering asteroids and comets with its gravity in the process. Some of those asteroids and comets slammed into early Earth, possibly bringing water here in the process the key ingredient for life as we know it.</p>

            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in our Solar System, after Jupiter. It is known for its stunning rings, which are made up of ice and rock particles. Saturn is a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. It is one of the most distant planets visible to the naked eye, and it was known to ancient astronomers. However, its rings were not discovered until 1610 by Galileo Galilei, who could not fully resolve them but noticed that the planet appeared to have “ears.”</p>

            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and the third most massive of the gas giants. It is a unique planet in our Solar System because it rotates on its side. Uranus is a cold world, with an atmosphere made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its blue-green color comes from methane gas in the atmosphere, which absorbs red light and reflects blue and green light. The planet has a complex system of rings and 27 known moons. Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, who initially thought it was a comet.</p>

Neptune is known for its deep blue color, which is due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. It has a dynamic atmosphere with strong winds and storm systems. The planet has a faint ring system and 14 known moons. Neptune was discovered in 1846 by Johann Galle and Heinrich d'Arrest, who used mathematical predictions to find the planet.</p>
